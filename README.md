# game-erl
A now-retired attempt to implement a GameBoy emulator in Erlang. I wanted to
write a GameBoy emulator, and I also wanted to learn Erlang, and this was the
result. I learned a lot and really grew to like Erlang as a language, although I
realized that it wouldn't be nearly performant enough for anywhere close to
real-time emulation. That's okay, we all have our strengths and weaknesses. But
this project isn't going to go any further.
